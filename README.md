# WEC-Sim Control Strategy Evaluation

This repository contains a **WEC-Sim-based simulation framework** to evaluate and compare different control strategies for a **point absorber wave energy converter (WEC)**. The implemented controllers aim to maximize absorbed energy from incident waves by dynamically regulating the PTO (power take-off) system.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The simulation investigates the following control strategy:

- **SMC (Sliding Mode Controller)**: A robust nonlinear controller designed to handle system uncertainties.

## 📦 Requirements

Ensure the following software/tools are installed:

- MATLAB (R2020a or later)
- Simulink
- [WEC-Sim Toolbox]https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/main/user/getting_started.html
- Hydrodynamic coefficients file (from NEMOH, Capytaine, or WAMIT)

## 🛠️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Energy-Control-and-Optimization-Lab/Control-codesign-of-wave-energy-converters.git
cd Control-codesign-of-wave-energy-converters
```

### 2. Set Up WEC-Sim

In MATLAB, add WEC-Sim to your path:

```matlab
addpath('path_to_WEC-Sim')
```

### 3. Configure Simulation

Open and edit `wecSimInputFile.m`:

- Ensure correct paths to `.h5` and `.stl` files
- Choose wave type and characteristics (e.g., JONSWAP spectrum)

### 4. Run the Simulation

```matlab
wecSim
```

Simulation results (heave motion, PTO force, absorbed energy, etc.) will be saved in the `Results/` folder.
