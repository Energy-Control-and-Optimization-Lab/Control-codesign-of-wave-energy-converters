# Wave Energy Converter (WEC) Simulation with Advanced Controllers
This repository contains a WEC-Sim based model to simulate and evaluate different control strategies applied to a point absorber wave energy converter. The implemented controllers aim to maximize the absorbed energy from wave motion.

# üöÄ Overview

This project includes:

PI Controller: A traditional proportional-integral controller.

SMC (Sliding Mode Controller): A robust nonlinear controller.

SMC-Singular: Enhanced SMC with singularity-based logic.

SMC-Tanh: SMC with tanh-based smoothing for reduced chattering.

# Set Up WEC-Sim

Ensure the WEC-Sim toolbox is on your MATLAB path:

addpath('path_to_wecSim');
wecSim

# Configure Simulation

Open and edit wecSimInputFile.m to:

Select the desired controller

Verify .h5 and .stl file paths

Choose wave type (e.g., irregular with 'JS' for JONSWAP)

# Run the Simulation

In MATLAB:
wecSim
