# Wave Energy Converter (WEC) Simulation with Advanced Controllers
This repository contains a WEC-Sim based model to simulate and evaluate different control strategies applied to a point absorber wave energy converter. The implemented controllers aim to maximize the absorbed energy from wave motion.
